Questions about how to use G\+L\+FW should be asked either in the \href{https://discourse.glfw.org/c/support}{\texttt{ support section}} of the forum, under the \href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/glfw}{\texttt{ Stack Overflow tag}} or \href{https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/glfw}{\texttt{ Game Development tag}} on Stack Exchange or in the I\+RC channel {\ttfamily \#glfw} on \href{http://freenode.net/}{\texttt{ Freenode}}.

Questions about the design or implementation of G\+L\+FW or about future plans should be asked in the \href{https://discourse.glfw.org/c/dev}{\texttt{ dev section}} of the forum or in the I\+RC channel. Please don\textquotesingle{}t open a Git\+Hub issue to discuss design questions without first checking with a maintainer.\hypertarget{md_LightFramework_libs_glfw-3_83_83_docs_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Reporting a bug}\label{md_LightFramework_libs_glfw-3_83_83_docs_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md3}
If G\+L\+FW is behaving unexpectedly at run-\/time, start by setting an \href{https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/intro_guide.html\#error_handling}{\texttt{ error callback}}. G\+L\+FW will often tell you the cause of an error via this callback. If it doesn\textquotesingle{}t, that might be a separate bug.

If G\+L\+FW is crashing or triggering asserts, make sure that all your object handles and other pointers are valid.

For bugs where it makes sense, a short, self contained example is absolutely invaluable. Just put it inline in the body text. Note that if the bug is reproducible with one of the test programs that come with G\+L\+FW, just mention that instead.

{\bfseries{Don\textquotesingle{}t worry about adding too much information}}. Unimportant information can be abbreviated or removed later, but missing information can stall bug fixing, especially when your schedule doesn\textquotesingle{}t align with that of the maintainer.

{\bfseries{Please provide text as text, not as images}}. This includes code, error messages and any other text. Text in images cannot be found by other users searching for the same problem and may have to be re-\/typed by maintainers when debugging.

You don\textquotesingle{}t need to manually indent your code or other text to quote it with Git\+Hub Markdown; just surround it with triple backticks\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}```
Some quoted text.
```
\end{DoxyVerb}


You can also add syntax highlighting by appending the common file extension\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}```c
int five(void)
{
    return 5;
}
```
\end{DoxyVerb}


There are issue labels for both platforms and G\+PU manufacturers, so there is no need to mention these in the subject line. If you do, it will be removed when the issue is labeled.

If your bug is already reported, please add any new information you have, or if it already has everything, give it a \+:+1\+:.\hypertarget{md_LightFramework_libs_glfw-3_83_83_docs_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsection{Reporting a compile or link bug}\label{md_LightFramework_libs_glfw-3_83_83_docs_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md4}
{\bfseries{Note\+:}} G\+L\+FW needs many system A\+P\+Is to do its job, which on some platforms means linking to many system libraries. If you are using G\+L\+FW as a static library, that means your application needs to link to these in addition to G\+L\+FW.

{\bfseries{Note\+:}} Check the \href{https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html}{\texttt{ Compiling G\+L\+FW}} guide and or \href{https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/build.html}{\texttt{ Building applications}} guide for before opening an issue of this kind. Most issues are caused by a missing package or linker flag.

Always include the {\bfseries{operating system name and version}} (e.\+g. {\ttfamily Windows 7 64-\/bit} or {\ttfamily Ubuntu 15.\+10}) and the {\bfseries{compiler name and version}} (e.\+g. {\ttfamily Visual C++ 2015 Update 2}). If you are using an official release of G\+L\+FW, include the {\bfseries{G\+L\+FW release version}} (e.\+g. {\ttfamily 3.\+1.\+2}), otherwise include the {\bfseries{G\+L\+FW commit ID}} (e.\+g. {\ttfamily 3795d78b14ef06008889cc422a1fb8d642597751}) from Git.

Please also include the {\bfseries{complete build log}} from your compiler and linker, even if it\textquotesingle{}s long. It can always be shortened later, if necessary.\hypertarget{md_LightFramework_libs_glfw-3_83_83_docs_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsubsection{Quick template}\label{md_LightFramework_libs_glfw-3_83_83_docs_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md5}

{\bfseries{Note\+:}} Windows ships with graphics drivers that do not support Open\+GL. If G\+L\+FW says that your machine lacks support for Open\+GL, it very likely does. Install drivers from the computer manufacturer or graphics card manufacturer (\href{https://www.geforce.com/drivers}{\texttt{ Nvidia}}, \href{https://www.amd.com/en/support}{\texttt{ A\+MD}}, \href{https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html}{\texttt{ Intel}}) to fix this.

{\bfseries{Note\+:}} A\+MD only supports Open\+GL ES on Windows via E\+GL. See the \href{https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/window_guide.html\#window_hints_ctx}{\texttt{ G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+C\+O\+N\+T\+E\+X\+T\+\_\+\+C\+R\+E\+A\+T\+I\+O\+N\+\_\+\+A\+PI}} hint for how to select E\+GL.

Please verify that context creation also fails with the {\ttfamily glfwinfo} tool before reporting it as a bug. This tool is included in the G\+L\+FW source tree as {\ttfamily tests/glfwinfo.\+c} and is built along with the library. It has switches for all G\+L\+FW context and framebuffer hints. Run {\ttfamily glfwinfo -\/h} for a complete list.

Always include the {\bfseries{operating system name and version}} (e.\+g. {\ttfamily Windows 7 64-\/bit} or {\ttfamily Ubuntu 15.\+10}). If you are using an official release of G\+L\+FW, include the {\bfseries{G\+L\+FW release version}} (e.\+g. {\ttfamily 3.\+1.\+2}), otherwise include the {\bfseries{G\+L\+FW commit ID}} (e.\+g. {\ttfamily 3795d78b14ef06008889cc422a1fb8d642597751}) from Git.

If you are running your program in a virtual machine, please mention this and include the {\bfseries{VM name and version}} (e.\+g. {\ttfamily Virtual\+Box 5.\+1}).

Please also include the {\bfseries{G\+L\+FW version string}} ({\ttfamily 3.\+2.\+0 X11 E\+GL clock\+\_\+gettime /dev/js}), as described \href{https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/intro.html\#intro_version_string}{\texttt{ here}}, the {\bfseries{G\+PU model and driver version}} (e.\+g. {\ttfamily Ge\+Force G\+T\+X660 with 352.\+79}), and the {\bfseries{output of {\ttfamily glfwinfo}}} (with switches matching any hints you set in your code) when reporting this kind of bug. If this tool doesn\textquotesingle{}t run on the machine, mention that instead.\hypertarget{md_LightFramework_libs_glfw-3_83_83_docs_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsubsection{Quick template}\label{md_LightFramework_libs_glfw-3_83_83_docs_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md9}

{\bfseries{Note\+:}} On headless systems on some platforms, no monitors are reported. This causes glfw\+Get\+Primary\+Monitor to return {\ttfamily N\+U\+LL}, which not all applications are prepared for.

{\bfseries{Note\+:}} Some third-\/party tools report more video modes than are approved of by the OS. For safety and compatibility, G\+L\+FW only reports video modes the OS wants programs to use. This is not a bug.

The {\ttfamily monitors} tool is included in the G\+L\+FW source tree as {\ttfamily tests/monitors.\+c} and is built along with the library. It lists all information G\+L\+FW provides about monitors it detects.

Always include the {\bfseries{operating system name and version}} (e.\+g. {\ttfamily Windows 7 64-\/bit} or {\ttfamily Ubuntu 15.\+10}). If you are using an official release of G\+L\+FW, include the {\bfseries{G\+L\+FW release version}} (e.\+g. {\ttfamily 3.\+1.\+2}), otherwise include the {\bfseries{G\+L\+FW commit ID}} (e.\+g. {\ttfamily 3795d78b14ef06008889cc422a1fb8d642597751}) from Git.

If you are running your program in a virtual machine, please mention this and include the {\bfseries{VM name and version}} (e.\+g. {\ttfamily Virtual\+Box 5.\+1}).

Please also include any {\bfseries{error messages}} provided to your application via the \href{https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/intro_guide.html\#error_handling}{\texttt{ error callback}} and the {\bfseries{output of {\ttfamily monitors}}} when reporting this kind of bug.

{\bfseries{Note\+:}} The exact ordering of related window events will sometimes differ.

{\bfseries{Note\+:}} Window moving and resizing (by the user) will block the main thread on some platforms. This is not a bug. Set a \href{https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/window.html\#window_refresh}{\texttt{ refresh callback}} if you want to keep the window contents updated during a move or size operation.

The {\ttfamily events} tool is included in the G\+L\+FW source tree as {\ttfamily tests/events.\+c} and is built along with the library. It prints all information provided to every callback supported by G\+L\+FW as events occur. Each event is listed with the time and a unique number to make discussions about event logs easier. The tool has command-\/line options for creating multiple windows and full screen windows.

Always include the {\bfseries{operating system name and version}} (e.\+g. {\ttfamily Windows 7 64-\/bit} or {\ttfamily Ubuntu 15.\+10}). If you are using an official release of G\+L\+FW, include the {\bfseries{G\+L\+FW release version}} (e.\+g. {\ttfamily 3.\+1.\+2}), otherwise include the {\bfseries{G\+L\+FW commit ID}} (e.\+g. {\ttfamily 3795d78b14ef06008889cc422a1fb8d642597751}) from Git.

If you are running your program in a virtual machine, please mention this and include the {\bfseries{VM name and version}} (e.\+g. {\ttfamily Virtual\+Box 5.\+1}).

Please also include any {\bfseries{error messages}} provided to your application via the \href{https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/intro_guide.html\#error_handling}{\texttt{ error callback}} and if relevant, the {\bfseries{output of {\ttfamily events}}} when reporting this kind of bug. If this tool doesn\textquotesingle{}t run on the machine, mention this instead.

{\bfseries{X11\+:}} If possible, please include what desktop environment (e.\+g. G\+N\+O\+ME, Unity, K\+DE) and/or window manager (e.\+g. Openbox, dwm, Window Maker) you are running. If the bug is related to keyboard input, please include any input method (e.\+g. ibus, S\+C\+IM) you are using.\hypertarget{md_LightFramework_libs_glfw-3_83_83_docs_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md13}{}\doxysubsubsection{Quick template}\label{md_LightFramework_libs_glfw-3_83_83_docs_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md13}

Please explain why you need the feature and how you intend to use it. If you have a specific A\+PI design in mind, please add that as well. If you have or are planning to write code for the feature, see the section below.

If there already is a request for the feature you need, add your specific use case unless it is already mentioned. If it is, give it a \+:+1\+:.\hypertarget{md_LightFramework_libs_glfw-3_83_83_docs_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md19}{}\doxysection{Contributing a bug fix}\label{md_LightFramework_libs_glfw-3_83_83_docs_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md19}
{\bfseries{Note\+:}} You must have all necessary \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property}{\texttt{ intellectual property rights}} to any code you contribute. If you did not write the code yourself, you must explain where it came from and under what license you received it. Even code using the same license as G\+L\+FW may not be copied without attribution.

{\bfseries{There is no preferred patch size}}. A one character fix is just as welcome as a thousand line one, if that is the appropriate size for the fix.

In addition to the code, a complete bug fix includes\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Change log entry in {\ttfamily R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E.\+md}, describing the incorrect behavior
\item Credits entries for all authors of the bug fix
\end{DoxyItemize}

Bug fixes will not be rejected because they don\textquotesingle{}t include all the above parts, but please keep in mind that maintainer time is finite and that there are many other bugs and features to work on.

If the patch fixes a bug introduced after the last release, it should not get a change log entry.

If you haven\textquotesingle{}t already, read the excellent article \href{https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/}{\texttt{ How to Write a Git Commit Message}}.\hypertarget{md_LightFramework_libs_glfw-3_83_83_docs_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md20}{}\doxysection{Contributing a feature}\label{md_LightFramework_libs_glfw-3_83_83_docs_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md20}
{\bfseries{Note\+:}} You must have all necessary rights to any code you contribute. If you did not write the code yourself, you must explain where it came from and under what license. Even code using the same license as G\+L\+FW may not be copied without attribution.

{\bfseries{Note\+:}} If you haven\textquotesingle{}t already implemented the feature, check first if there already is an open issue for it and if it\textquotesingle{}s already being developed in an \href{https://github.com/glfw/glfw/branches/all}{\texttt{ experimental branch}}.

{\bfseries{There is no preferred patch size}}. A one character change is just as welcome as one adding a thousand line one, if that is the appropriate size for the feature.

In addition to the code, a complete feature includes\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Change log entry in {\ttfamily R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E.\+md}, listing all new symbols
\item News page entry, briefly describing the feature
\item Guide documentation, with minimal examples, in the relevant guide
\item Reference documentation, with all applicable tags
\item Cross-\/references and mentions in appropriate places
\item Credits entries for all authors of the feature
\end{DoxyItemize}

If the feature requires platform-\/specific code, at minimum stubs must be added for the new platform function to all supported and experimental platforms.

If it adds a new callback, support for it must be added to {\ttfamily tests/event.\+c}.

If it adds a new monitor property, support for it must be added to {\ttfamily tests/monitor.\+c}.

If it adds a new Open\+GL, Open\+GL ES or Vulkan option or extension, support for it must be added to {\ttfamily tests/glfwinfo.\+c} and the behavior of the library when the extension is missing documented in {\ttfamily docs/compat.\+dox}.

If you haven\textquotesingle{}t already, read the excellent article \href{https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/}{\texttt{ How to Write a Git Commit Message}}.

Features will not be rejected because they don\textquotesingle{}t include all the above parts, but please keep in mind that maintainer time is finite and that there are many other features and bugs to work on.

Please also keep in mind that any part of the public A\+PI that has been included in a release cannot be changed until the next {\itshape major} version. Features can be added and existing parts can sometimes be overloaded (in the general sense of doing more things, not in the C++ sense), but code written to the A\+PI of one minor release should both compile and run on subsequent minor releases.
