Meta factory to be used for reflection purposes. 

The meta factory is an utility class used to reflect types, data members and functions of all sorts. This class ensures that the underlying web of types is built correctly and performs some checks in debug mode to ensure that there are no subtle errors at runtime. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
Light\+Framework/libs/entt/entt.\+hpp\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
