This is about compiling the G\+L\+FW library itself. For information on how to build applications that use G\+L\+FW, see \mbox{\hyperlink{build_guide}{Building applications}}.\hypertarget{compile_guide_compile_cmake}{}\doxysection{Using C\+Make}\label{compile_guide_compile_cmake}
G\+L\+FW uses \href{https://cmake.org/}{\texttt{ C\+Make}} to generate project files or makefiles for a particular development environment. If you are on a Unix-\/like system such as Linux or Free\+B\+SD or have a package system like Fink, Mac\+Ports, Cygwin or Homebrew, you can install its C\+Make package. If not, you can download installers for Windows and mac\+OS from the \href{https://cmake.org/}{\texttt{ C\+Make website}}.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
C\+Make only generates project files or makefiles. It does not compile the actual G\+L\+FW library. To compile G\+L\+FW, first generate these files for your chosen development environment and then use them to compile the actual G\+L\+FW library.
\end{DoxyNote}
\hypertarget{compile_guide_compile_deps}{}\doxysubsection{Dependencies}\label{compile_guide_compile_deps}
Once you have installed C\+Make, make sure that all other dependencies are available. On some platforms, G\+L\+FW needs a few additional packages to be installed. See the section for your chosen platform and development environment below.\hypertarget{compile_guide_compile_deps_msvc}{}\doxysubsubsection{Dependencies for Visual C++ on Windows}\label{compile_guide_compile_deps_msvc}
The Windows S\+DK bundled with Visual C++ already contains all the necessary headers, link libraries and tools except for C\+Make. Move on to \mbox{\hyperlink{compile_guide_compile_generate}{Generating build files with C\+Make}}.\hypertarget{compile_guide_compile_deps_mingw}{}\doxysubsubsection{Dependencies for Min\+G\+W or Min\+G\+W-\/w64 on Windows}\label{compile_guide_compile_deps_mingw}
Both the Min\+GW and the Min\+G\+W-\/w64 packages already contain all the necessary headers, link libraries and tools except for C\+Make. Move on to \mbox{\hyperlink{compile_guide_compile_generate}{Generating build files with C\+Make}}.\hypertarget{compile_guide_compile_deps_mingw_cross}{}\doxysubsubsection{Dependencies for Min\+G\+W or Min\+G\+W-\/w64 cross-\/compilation}\label{compile_guide_compile_deps_mingw_cross}
Both Cygwin and many Linux distributions have Min\+GW or Min\+G\+W-\/w64 packages. For example, Cygwin has the {\ttfamily mingw64-\/i686-\/gcc} and {\ttfamily mingw64-\/x86\+\_\+64-\/gcc} packages for 32-\/ and 64-\/bit version of Min\+G\+W-\/w64, while Debian G\+N\+U/\+Linux and derivatives like Ubuntu have the {\ttfamily mingw-\/w64} package for both.

G\+L\+FW has C\+Make toolchain files in the {\ttfamily C\+Make/} directory that set up cross-\/compilation of Windows binaries. To use these files you add an option when running {\ttfamily cmake} to generate the project files or makefiles\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/DCMAKE\_TOOLCHAIN\_FILE=<toolchain-\/file> .}
\end{DoxyCode}


The exact toolchain file to use depends on the prefix used by the Min\+GW or Min\+G\+W-\/w64 binaries on your system. You can usually see this in the /usr directory. For example, both the Debian/\+Ubuntu and Cygwin Min\+G\+W-\/w64 packages have {\ttfamily /usr/x86\+\_\+64-\/w64-\/mingw32} for the 64-\/bit compilers, so the correct invocation would be\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/DCMAKE\_TOOLCHAIN\_FILE=CMake/x86\_64-\/w64-\/mingw32.cmake .}
\end{DoxyCode}


For more details see the article \href{https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/wikis/doc/cmake/CrossCompiling}{\texttt{ C\+Make Cross Compiling}} on the C\+Make wiki.

Once you have this set up, move on to \mbox{\hyperlink{compile_guide_compile_generate}{Generating build files with C\+Make}}.\hypertarget{compile_guide_compile_deps_xcode}{}\doxysubsubsection{Dependencies for Xcode on mac\+OS}\label{compile_guide_compile_deps_xcode}
Xcode comes with all necessary tools except for C\+Make. The required headers and libraries are included in the core mac\+OS frameworks. Xcode can be downloaded from the Mac App Store or from the A\+DC Member Center.

Once you have Xcode installed, move on to \mbox{\hyperlink{compile_guide_compile_generate}{Generating build files with C\+Make}}.\hypertarget{compile_guide_compile_deps_x11}{}\doxysubsubsection{Dependencies for Linux and X11}\label{compile_guide_compile_deps_x11}
To compile G\+L\+FW for X11, you need to have the X11 packages installed, as well as the basic development tools like G\+CC and make. For example, on Ubuntu and other distributions based on Debian G\+N\+U/\+Linux, you need to install the {\ttfamily xorg-\/dev} package, which pulls in all X.\+org header packages.

Once you have installed the necessary packages, move on to \mbox{\hyperlink{compile_guide_compile_generate}{Generating build files with C\+Make}}.\hypertarget{compile_guide_compile_deps_wayland}{}\doxysubsubsection{Dependencies for Linux and Wayland}\label{compile_guide_compile_deps_wayland}
To compile G\+L\+FW for Wayland, you need to have the Wayland packages installed, as well as the basic development tools like G\+CC and make. For example, on Ubuntu and other distributions based on Debian G\+N\+U/\+Linux, you need to install the {\ttfamily libwayland-\/dev} package, which contains all Wayland headers and pulls in wayland-\/scanner, as well as the {\ttfamily wayland-\/protocols} and {\ttfamily extra-\/cmake-\/modules} packages.

Once you have installed the necessary packages, move on to \mbox{\hyperlink{compile_guide_compile_generate}{Generating build files with C\+Make}}.\hypertarget{compile_guide_compile_deps_osmesa}{}\doxysubsection{Dependencies for Linux and O\+S\+Mesa}\label{compile_guide_compile_deps_osmesa}
To compile G\+L\+FW for O\+S\+Mesa, you need to install the O\+S\+Mesa library and header packages. For example, on Ubuntu and other distributions based on Debian G\+N\+U/\+Linux, you need to install the {\ttfamily libosmesa6-\/dev} package. The O\+S\+Mesa library is required at runtime for context creation and is loaded on demand.

Once you have installed the necessary packages, move on to \mbox{\hyperlink{compile_guide_compile_generate}{Generating build files with C\+Make}}.\hypertarget{compile_guide_compile_generate}{}\doxysubsection{Generating build files with C\+Make}\label{compile_guide_compile_generate}
Once you have all necessary dependencies it is time to generate the project files or makefiles for your development environment. C\+Make needs to know two paths for this\+: the path to the {\itshape root} directory of the G\+L\+FW source tree (i.\+e. {\itshape not} the {\ttfamily src} subdirectory) and the target path for the generated files and compiled binaries. If these are the same, it is called an in-\/tree build, otherwise it is called an out-\/of-\/tree build.

One of several advantages of out-\/of-\/tree builds is that you can generate files and compile for different development environments using a single source tree.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
This section is about generating the project files or makefiles necessary to compile the G\+L\+FW library, not about compiling the actual library.
\end{DoxyNote}
\hypertarget{compile_guide_compile_generate_cli}{}\doxysubsubsection{Generating files with the C\+Make command-\/line tool}\label{compile_guide_compile_generate_cli}
To make an in-\/tree build, enter the {\itshape root} directory of the G\+L\+FW source tree (i.\+e. {\itshape not} the {\ttfamily src} subdirectory) and run C\+Make. The current directory is used as target path, while the path provided as an argument is used to find the source tree.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd <glfw-\/root-\/dir>}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake .}
\end{DoxyCode}


To make an out-\/of-\/tree build, make a directory outside of the source tree, enter it and run C\+Make with the (relative or absolute) path to the root of the source tree as an argument.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdir glfw-\/build}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd glfw-\/build}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake <glfw-\/root-\/dir>}
\end{DoxyCode}


Once you have generated the project files or makefiles for your chosen development environment, move on to \mbox{\hyperlink{compile_guide_compile_compile}{Compiling the library}}.\hypertarget{compile_guide_compile_generate_gui}{}\doxysubsubsection{Generating files with the C\+Make G\+UI}\label{compile_guide_compile_generate_gui}
If you are using the G\+UI version, choose the root of the G\+L\+FW source tree as source location and the same directory or another, empty directory as the destination for binaries. Choose {\itshape Configure}, change any options you wish to, {\itshape Configure} again to let the changes take effect and then {\itshape Generate}.

Once you have generated the project files or makefiles for your chosen development environment, move on to \mbox{\hyperlink{compile_guide_compile_compile}{Compiling the library}}.\hypertarget{compile_guide_compile_compile}{}\doxysubsection{Compiling the library}\label{compile_guide_compile_compile}
You should now have all required dependencies and the project files or makefiles necessary to compile G\+L\+FW. Go ahead and compile the actual G\+L\+FW library with these files, as you would with any other project.

Once the G\+L\+FW library is compiled, you are ready to build your applications, linking it to the G\+L\+FW library. See \mbox{\hyperlink{build_guide}{Building applications}} for more information.\hypertarget{compile_guide_compile_options}{}\doxysubsection{C\+Make options}\label{compile_guide_compile_options}
The C\+Make files for G\+L\+FW provide a number of options, although not all are available on all supported platforms. Some of these are de facto standards among projects using C\+Make and so have no {\ttfamily G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+} prefix.

If you are using the G\+UI version of C\+Make, these are listed and can be changed from there. If you are using the command-\/line version of C\+Make you can use the {\ttfamily ccmake} ncurses G\+UI to set options. Some package systems like Ubuntu and other distributions based on Debian G\+N\+U/\+Linux have this tool in a separate {\ttfamily cmake-\/curses-\/gui} package.

Finally, if you don\textquotesingle{}t want to use any G\+UI, you can set options from the {\ttfamily cmake} command-\/line with the {\ttfamily -\/D} flag.

These symbols need to be exported by the E\+XE to be detected by the driver, so the override will not work if G\+L\+FW is built as a D\+LL.\hypertarget{compile_guide_compile_manual}{}\doxysection{Compiling G\+L\+F\+W manually}\label{compile_guide_compile_manual}
If you wish to compile G\+L\+FW without its C\+Make build environment then you will have to do at least some of the platform detection yourself. G\+L\+FW needs a configuration macro to be defined in order to know what window system it\textquotesingle{}s being compiled for and also has optional, platform-\/specific ones for various features.

When building with C\+Make, the {\ttfamily glfw\+\_\+config.\+h} configuration header is generated based on the current platform and C\+Make options. The G\+L\+FW C\+Make environment defines {\bfseries{G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+U\+S\+E\+\_\+\+C\+O\+N\+F\+I\+G\+\_\+H}}, which causes this header to be included by {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{internal_8h_source}{internal.\+h}}}. Without this macro, G\+L\+FW will expect the necessary configuration macros to be defined on the command-\/line.

The window creation A\+PI is used to create windows, handle input, monitors, gamma ramps and clipboard. The options are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{\+\_\+\+G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+C\+O\+C\+OA}} to use the Cocoa frameworks
\item {\bfseries{\+\_\+\+G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+W\+I\+N32}} to use the Win32 A\+PI
\item {\bfseries{\+\_\+\+G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+X11}} to use the X Window System
\item {\bfseries{\+\_\+\+G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+W\+A\+Y\+L\+A\+ND}} to use the Wayland A\+PI (experimental and incomplete)
\item {\bfseries{\+\_\+\+G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+O\+S\+M\+E\+SA}} to use the O\+S\+Mesa A\+PI (headless and non-\/interactive)
\end{DoxyItemize}

If you are building G\+L\+FW as a shared library / dynamic library / D\+LL then you must also define {\bfseries{\+\_\+\+G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+D\+LL}}. Otherwise, you must not define it.

If you are linking the Vulkan loader directly with your application then you must also define {\bfseries{\+\_\+\+G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+V\+U\+L\+K\+A\+N\+\_\+\+S\+T\+A\+T\+IC}}. Otherwise, G\+L\+FW will attempt to use the external version.

If you are using a custom name for the Vulkan, E\+GL, G\+LX, O\+S\+Mesa, Open\+GL, G\+L\+E\+Sv1 or G\+L\+E\+Sv2 library, you can override the default names by defining those you need of {\bfseries{\+\_\+\+G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+V\+U\+L\+K\+A\+N\+\_\+\+L\+I\+B\+R\+A\+RY}}, {\bfseries{\+\_\+\+G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+E\+G\+L\+\_\+\+L\+I\+B\+R\+A\+RY}}, {\bfseries{\+\_\+\+G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+G\+L\+X\+\_\+\+L\+I\+B\+R\+A\+RY}}, {\bfseries{\+\_\+\+G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+O\+S\+M\+E\+S\+A\+\_\+\+L\+I\+B\+R\+A\+RY}}, {\bfseries{\+\_\+\+G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+O\+P\+E\+N\+G\+L\+\_\+\+L\+I\+B\+R\+A\+RY}}, {\bfseries{\+\_\+\+G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+G\+L\+E\+S\+V1\+\_\+\+L\+I\+B\+R\+A\+RY}} and {\bfseries{\+\_\+\+G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+G\+L\+E\+S\+V2\+\_\+\+L\+I\+B\+R\+A\+RY}}. Otherwise, G\+L\+FW will use the built-\/in default names.

For the E\+GL context creation A\+PI, the following options are available\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{\+\_\+\+G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+U\+S\+E\+\_\+\+E\+G\+L\+P\+L\+A\+T\+F\+O\+R\+M\+\_\+H}} to use an existing {\ttfamily E\+G\+L/eglplatform.\+h} header file for native handle types (fallback)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
None of the \mbox{\hyperlink{build_guide_build_macros}{G\+L\+FW header option macros}} may be defined during the compilation of G\+L\+FW. If you define any of these in your build files, make sure they are not applied to the G\+L\+FW sources. 
\end{DoxyNote}
