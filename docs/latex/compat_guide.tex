This guide describes the various A\+PI extensions used by this version of G\+L\+FW. It lists what are essentially implementation details, but which are nonetheless vital knowledge for developers intending to deploy their applications on a wide range of machines.

The information in this guide is not a part of G\+L\+FW A\+PI, but merely preconditions for some parts of the library to function on a given machine. Any part of this information may change in future versions of G\+L\+FW and that will not be considered a breaking A\+PI change.\hypertarget{compat_guide_compat_x11}{}\doxysection{X11 extensions, protocols and I\+P\+C standards}\label{compat_guide_compat_x11}
As G\+L\+FW uses Xlib directly, without any intervening toolkit library, it has sole responsibility for interacting well with the many and varied window managers in use on Unix-\/like systems. In order for applications and window managers to work well together, a number of standards and conventions have been developed that regulate behavior outside the scope of the X11 A\+PI; most importantly the \href{https://www.tronche.com/gui/x/icccm/}{\texttt{ Inter-\/\+Client Communication Conventions Manual}} (I\+C\+C\+CM) and \href{https://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-latest.html}{\texttt{ Extended Window Manager Hints}} (E\+W\+MH) standards.

G\+L\+FW uses the {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+M\+O\+T\+I\+F\+\_\+\+W\+M\+\_\+\+H\+I\+N\+TS} window property to support borderless windows. If the running window manager does not support this property, the {\ttfamily G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+D\+E\+C\+O\+R\+A\+T\+ED} hint will have no effect.

G\+L\+FW uses the I\+C\+C\+CM {\ttfamily W\+M\+\_\+\+D\+E\+L\+E\+T\+E\+\_\+\+W\+I\+N\+D\+OW} protocol to intercept the user attempting to close the G\+L\+FW window. If the running window manager does not support this protocol, the close callback will never be called.

G\+L\+FW uses the E\+W\+MH {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+N\+E\+T\+\_\+\+W\+M\+\_\+\+P\+I\+NG} protocol, allowing the window manager notify the user when the application has stopped responding, i.\+e. when it has ceased to process events. If the running window manager does not support this protocol, the user will not be notified if the application locks up.

G\+L\+FW uses the E\+W\+MH {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+N\+E\+T\+\_\+\+W\+M\+\_\+\+S\+T\+A\+T\+E\+\_\+\+F\+U\+L\+L\+S\+C\+R\+E\+EN} window state to tell the window manager to make the G\+L\+FW window full screen. If the running window manager does not support this state, full screen windows may not work properly. G\+L\+FW has a fallback code path in case this state is unavailable, but every window manager behaves slightly differently in this regard.

G\+L\+FW uses the E\+W\+MH {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+N\+E\+T\+\_\+\+W\+M\+\_\+\+B\+Y\+P\+A\+S\+S\+\_\+\+C\+O\+M\+P\+O\+S\+I\+T\+OR} window property to tell a compositing window manager to un-\/redirect full screen G\+L\+FW windows. If the running window manager uses compositing but does not support this property then additional copying may be performed for each buffer swap of full screen windows.

G\+L\+FW uses the \href{https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/ClipboardManager/}{\texttt{ clipboard manager protocol}} to push a clipboard string (i.\+e. selection) owned by a G\+L\+FW window about to be destroyed to the clipboard manager. If there is no running clipboard manager, the clipboard string will be unavailable once the window has been destroyed.

G\+L\+FW uses the \href{https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/XDND/}{\texttt{ X drag-\/and-\/drop protocol}} to provide file drop events. If the application originating the drag does not support this protocol, drag and drop will not work.

G\+L\+FW uses the X\+RandR 1.\+3 extension to provide multi-\/monitor support. If the running X server does not support this version of this extension, multi-\/monitor support will not function and only a single, desktop-\/spanning monitor will be reported.

G\+L\+FW uses the X\+RandR 1.\+3 and Xf86vidmode extensions to provide gamma ramp support. If the running X server does not support either or both of these extensions, gamma ramp support will not function.

G\+L\+FW uses the Xkb extension and detectable auto-\/repeat to provide keyboard input. If the running X server does not support this extension, a non-\/\+Xkb fallback path is used.

G\+L\+FW uses the X\+Input2 extension to provide raw, non-\/accelerated mouse motion when the cursor is disabled. If the running X server does not support this extension, regular accelerated mouse motion will be used.

G\+L\+FW uses both the X\+Render extension and the compositing manager to support transparent window framebuffers. If the running X server does not support this extension or there is no running compositing manager, the {\ttfamily G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+T\+R\+A\+N\+S\+P\+A\+R\+E\+N\+T\+\_\+\+F\+R\+A\+M\+E\+B\+U\+F\+F\+ER} framebuffer hint will have no effect.\hypertarget{compat_guide_compat_wayland}{}\doxysection{Wayland protocols and I\+P\+C standards}\label{compat_guide_compat_wayland}
As G\+L\+FW uses libwayland directly, without any intervening toolkit library, it has sole responsibility for interacting well with every compositor in use on Unix-\/like systems. Most of the features are provided by the core protocol, while cursor support is provided by the libwayland-\/cursor helper library, E\+GL integration by libwayland-\/egl, and keyboard handling by \href{https://xkbcommon.org/}{\texttt{ libxkbcommon}}. In addition, G\+L\+FW uses some protocols from wayland-\/protocols to provide additional features if the compositor supports them.

G\+L\+FW uses xkbcommon 0.\+5.\+0 to provide compose key support. When it has been built against an older xkbcommon, the compose key will be disabled even if it has been configured in the compositor.

G\+L\+FW uses the \href{https://cgit.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/tree/stable/xdg-shell/xdg-shell.xml}{\texttt{ xdg-\/shell protocol}} to provide better window management. This protocol is part of wayland-\/protocols 1.\+12, and mandatory at build time. If the running compositor does not support this protocol, the older \href{https://cgit.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland/tree/protocol/wayland.xml\#n972}{\texttt{ wl\+\_\+shell interface}} will be used instead. This will result in a worse integration with the desktop, especially on tiling compositors.

G\+L\+FW uses the \href{https://cgit.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/tree/unstable/relative-pointer/relative-pointer-unstable-v1.xml}{\texttt{ relative pointer protocol}} alongside the \href{https://cgit.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/tree/unstable/pointer-constraints/pointer-constraints-unstable-v1.xml}{\texttt{ pointer constraints protocol}} to implement disabled cursor. These two protocols are part of wayland-\/protocols 1.\+1, and mandatory at build time. If the running compositor does not support both of these protocols, disabling the cursor will have no effect.

G\+L\+FW uses the \href{https://cgit.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/tree/unstable/idle-inhibit/idle-inhibit-unstable-v1.xml}{\texttt{ idle inhibit protocol}} to prohibit the screensaver from starting. This protocol is part of wayland-\/protocols 1.\+6, and mandatory at build time. If the running compositor does not support this protocol, the screensaver may start even for full screen windows.

G\+L\+FW uses the \href{https://cgit.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/tree/unstable/xdg-decoration/xdg-decoration-unstable-v1.xml}{\texttt{ xdg-\/decoration protocol}} to request decorations to be drawn around its windows. This protocol is part of wayland-\/protocols 1.\+15, and mandatory at build time. If the running compositor does not support this protocol, a very simple frame will be drawn by G\+L\+FW itself, using the \href{https://cgit.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/tree/stable/viewporter/viewporter.xml}{\texttt{ viewporter protocol}} alongside \href{https://cgit.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland/tree/protocol/wayland.xml\#n2598}{\texttt{ subsurfaces}}. This protocol is part of wayland-\/protocols 1.\+4, and mandatory at build time. If the running compositor does not support this protocol either, no decorations will be drawn around windows.\hypertarget{compat_guide_compat_glx}{}\doxysection{G\+L\+X extensions}\label{compat_guide_compat_glx}
The G\+LX A\+PI is the default A\+PI used to create Open\+GL contexts on Unix-\/like systems using the X Window System.

G\+L\+FW uses the G\+LX 1.\+3 {\ttfamily G\+L\+X\+F\+B\+Config} functions to enumerate and select framebuffer pixel formats. If G\+LX 1.\+3 is not supported, \mbox{\hyperlink{group__init_gab41771f0215a2e0afb4cf1cf98082d40}{glfw\+Init}} will fail.

G\+L\+FW uses the {\ttfamily G\+L\+X\+\_\+\+M\+E\+S\+A\+\_\+swap\+\_\+control,} {\ttfamily G\+L\+X\+\_\+\+E\+X\+T\+\_\+swap\+\_\+control} and {\ttfamily G\+L\+X\+\_\+\+S\+G\+I\+\_\+swap\+\_\+control} extensions to provide vertical retrace synchronization (or {\itshape vsync}), in that order of preference. Where none of these extension are available, calling \mbox{\hyperlink{group__context_ga12a595c06947cec4967c6e1f14210a8a}{glfw\+Swap\+Interval}} will have no effect.

G\+L\+FW uses the {\ttfamily G\+L\+X\+\_\+\+A\+R\+B\+\_\+multisample} extension to create contexts with multisampling anti-\/aliasing. Where this extension is unavailable, the {\ttfamily G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+S\+A\+M\+P\+L\+ES} hint will have no effect.

G\+L\+FW uses the {\ttfamily G\+L\+X\+\_\+\+A\+R\+B\+\_\+create\+\_\+context} extension when available, even when creating Open\+GL contexts of version 2.\+1 and below. Where this extension is unavailable, the {\ttfamily G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+C\+O\+N\+T\+E\+X\+T\+\_\+\+V\+E\+R\+S\+I\+O\+N\+\_\+\+M\+A\+J\+OR} and {\ttfamily G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+C\+O\+N\+T\+E\+X\+T\+\_\+\+V\+E\+R\+S\+I\+O\+N\+\_\+\+M\+I\+N\+OR} hints will only be partially supported, the {\ttfamily G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+O\+P\+E\+N\+G\+L\+\_\+\+D\+E\+B\+U\+G\+\_\+\+C\+O\+N\+T\+E\+XT} hint will have no effect, and setting the {\ttfamily G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+O\+P\+E\+N\+G\+L\+\_\+\+P\+R\+O\+F\+I\+LE} or {\ttfamily G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+O\+P\+E\+N\+G\+L\+\_\+\+F\+O\+R\+W\+A\+R\+D\+\_\+\+C\+O\+M\+P\+AT} hints to {\ttfamily G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+T\+R\+UE} will cause \mbox{\hyperlink{group__window_gaaccd00fafe81e2db94e8cdf55721e055}{glfw\+Create\+Window}} to fail.

G\+L\+FW uses the {\ttfamily G\+L\+X\+\_\+\+A\+R\+B\+\_\+create\+\_\+context\+\_\+profile} extension to provide support for context profiles. Where this extension is unavailable, setting the {\ttfamily G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+O\+P\+E\+N\+G\+L\+\_\+\+P\+R\+O\+F\+I\+LE} hint to anything but {\ttfamily G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+O\+P\+E\+N\+G\+L\+\_\+\+A\+N\+Y\+\_\+\+P\+R\+O\+F\+I\+LE}, or setting {\ttfamily G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+C\+L\+I\+E\+N\+T\+\_\+\+A\+PI} to anything but {\ttfamily G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+O\+P\+E\+N\+G\+L\+\_\+\+A\+PI} or {\ttfamily G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+N\+O\+\_\+\+A\+PI} will cause \mbox{\hyperlink{group__window_gaaccd00fafe81e2db94e8cdf55721e055}{glfw\+Create\+Window}} to fail.

G\+L\+FW uses the {\ttfamily G\+L\+X\+\_\+\+A\+R\+B\+\_\+context\+\_\+flush\+\_\+control} extension to provide control over whether a context is flushed when it is released (made non-\/current). Where this extension is unavailable, the {\ttfamily G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+C\+O\+N\+T\+E\+X\+T\+\_\+\+R\+E\+L\+E\+A\+S\+E\+\_\+\+B\+E\+H\+A\+V\+I\+OR} hint will have no effect and the context will always be flushed when released.

G\+L\+FW uses the {\ttfamily G\+L\+X\+\_\+\+A\+R\+B\+\_\+framebuffer\+\_\+s\+R\+GB} and {\ttfamily G\+L\+X\+\_\+\+E\+X\+T\+\_\+framebuffer\+\_\+s\+R\+GB} extensions to provide support for s\+R\+GB framebuffers. Where both of these extensions are unavailable, the {\ttfamily G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+S\+R\+G\+B\+\_\+\+C\+A\+P\+A\+B\+LE} hint will have no effect.\hypertarget{compat_guide_compat_wgl}{}\doxysection{W\+G\+L extensions}\label{compat_guide_compat_wgl}
The W\+GL A\+PI is used to create Open\+GL contexts on Microsoft Windows and other implementations of the Win32 A\+PI, such as Wine.

G\+L\+FW uses either the {\ttfamily W\+G\+L\+\_\+\+E\+X\+T\+\_\+extension\+\_\+string} or the {\ttfamily W\+G\+L\+\_\+\+A\+R\+B\+\_\+extension\+\_\+string} extension to check for the presence of all other W\+GL extensions listed below. If both are available, the E\+XT one is preferred. If neither is available, no other extensions are used and many G\+L\+FW features related to context creation will have no effect or cause errors when used.

G\+L\+FW uses the {\ttfamily W\+G\+L\+\_\+\+E\+X\+T\+\_\+swap\+\_\+control} extension to provide vertical retrace synchronization (or {\itshape vsync}). Where this extension is unavailable, calling \mbox{\hyperlink{group__context_ga12a595c06947cec4967c6e1f14210a8a}{glfw\+Swap\+Interval}} will have no effect.

Support for Open\+GL 3.\+2 and above was introduced with OS X 10.\+7 and even then only forward-\/compatible, core profile contexts are supported. Support for Open\+GL 4.\+1 was introduced with OS X 10.\+9, also limited to forward-\/compatible, core profile contexts.
