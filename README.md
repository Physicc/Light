Hit Build

### On Terminal

* Change into directory

	`cd Light`

* Execute the following command

	`cmake --no-warn-unused-cli -HEditor -Bbuild -G"[Generator]"`

	Replace `[Generator]` with the compiler name you want to compile with, 
  `MinGW Makefiles`/`Unix Makefiles`/`Visual Studio 16 2019`. The corresponding Makefile/solution file is generated in `Light/build`

* If you want to build using Visual Studio 2019, just open the Solution File generated

If you do not have a dedicated GPU (or drivers for the dedicated GPU e.g. on Linux), you may need to run the following command on the terminal to set up the environment variables before running our program

`export MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=3.3`
